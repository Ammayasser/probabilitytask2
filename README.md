1- nCr= 12! /(8!* 4!) = 495
nCr = 8! /(4! * 4!) = 70
 the total number of ways that 12 students can take 3 different tests if 4 students are to take each test is:
495 * 70 = 34,650
2-    /-- a,b,c --\

3- i) P(A) = (4/12) * (3/11) = 1/11
   P(B) = (8/12) * (7/11) = 14/33
   ii) P(at least one item is defective) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 14/33 = 19/33
   
4- i)C(15,3) = 15! / (3! * 12!) = 455

The number of ways to choose 3 non-defective items from the 10 available is:

C(10,3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120

Therefore, the probability that none of the three selected items is defective is:

P(none defective) = 120/455 = 0.2637

ii) C(5,1) * C(10,2) = 5 * 45 = 225
iii) P(at least one defective) = 1 - 0.2637 = 0.7363

5- P(a person chosen randomly is a boy or from Mansoura university) = 15/30 = 1/2

6- i) P(A complement) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 3/8 = 5/8
   ii) P(B complement) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2
(iii) P(A complement intersection B complement) = 1/8
  (iv) P(A complement union B complement) = 1/2
(v) P(A intersection B complement) = 0
(vi) P(B intersection A complement) = 0
